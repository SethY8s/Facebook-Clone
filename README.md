# Facebook Clone

This project is a revamped version of my login component project. It currently has user Authentication to log people in, and a basic global state with redux, allowing you to send messages. Currently, most of the features aren't working, however, this will be my largest project to date and will contain many advanced concepts.

If you wish to copy some part of the code, feel free to clone it to your own device.

### `Clone`



### `npm install`
